    <string name="desc_not_found">Description not found.</string>
    <string name="desc_k_m67">A common defensive hand grenade, the M67 has a 3.5second fuse and can be thrown
    approximately 30 meters by the average soldier. The lethal effect of this grenade is limited against targets with
    modern body armor.</string>
    <string name="desc_k_mav">A remotely operated Micro Air Vehicle equipped with a suite of Motion Sensors and a camera
    with IRNV capabilities for aerial reconnaissance.</string>
    <string name="desc_k_c4">Remotely detonated Composition 4 explosive packs provide anti-material, anti-vehicle and
    anti-personnel abilities.</string>
    <string name="desc_k_medkit">A deployable Medical Kit provides healing over time to soldiers near the kit, greatly
    speeding the body’s natural healing processes.</string>
    <string name="desc_k_mortar">The M224 60mm Mortar is capable of firing High Explosive and Smoke rounds to provide
    suppressing fire and visual cover from indirect fire positions.</string>
    <string name="desc_k_mine">A hand placed Anti-Vehicle blast mine the M15 was first used by the US Military in the
    Korean War. A single mine is capable of disabling armored vehicles, and multiple mines can out right destroy any
    vehicle. The fuse of the M15 mine is set to detonate only when vehicles pass over it with a minium speed level.</string>
    <string name="desc_k_nogadget2">No Gadget Selected</string>
    <string name="desc_k_nogadget1">No Gadget Selected</string>
    <string name="desc_k_defib">Automated External Defibrillator (AED) allows an Assault soldier with proper medical
    training to revive a downed teammate within a short time after his apparent death.</string>
    <string name="desc_k_claymore">The M18A Claymore is a directional anti-personnel mine that is detonated by motion in
    front of the mine. The mine can be passed safely if the target is moving at low speeds.</string>
    <string name="desc_k_repair">A hand held oxy-fuel welding and cutting torch provides the engineer with the ability to
    both Repair Friendly and Damage Enemy vehicles.</string>
    <string name="desc_k_ugs">The Tactical Unattended Ground Sensor uses motion sensors to detect the presence of vehicles
    and infantry. The sensor emits an audible beep on detection and can be avoided by moving at low speed.</string>
    <string name="desc_k_eod">A remotely controlled Explosive Ordinance Disposal robot allows the engineer to repair and
    damage vehicles like a normal repair tool, but can also arm and disarm explosives and MCOM stations in Rush.</string>
    <string name="desc_k_soflam">The AN/PEQ-1 SOFLAM allows the Recon soldier to designate enemy vehicles for precision
    strikes. The SOFLAM is semi-autonomous and will designate targets even when unattended.</string>
    <string name="desc_k_ammo">The deployable Ammo Box refills ammunition for nearby soldiers. Explosives and grenades
    take longer to be resupplied than standard magazines.</string>
    <string name="desc_k_beacon">The AN-PRC-117F Radio allows the Recon soldier to deploy an additional Squad Spawn
    position. The Recon soldier must be part of a squad for this item to function.</string>
    <string name="desc_w_jackhammer">Fully automated shotgun prototyped by US</string>
    <string name="desc_w_g3">The G3 rifle is one of the most widely fielded Assault Rifles in the world. Multiple versions
    of the G3 exist, and it has been used in countries around the world, including Sweden where it was known as the AK4.
    This particular G3 is the A3 variant, with a fixed stock. The long barrel and firing heavy 7.62x51mm NATO round
    enable the G3A3 to reach out at longer ranges than most other Assault Rifles, but at the cost of heavy recoil.</string>
    <string name="desc_w_a91">An unusual weapon, even by Russian standards, the A-91 is a bullpup Carbine chambered in the
    5.56mm NATO round instead of a Russian caliber. Made from polymers, it features a forward shell ejection system that
    keeps shells well clear of the shooter’s face upon ejection. The bullpup configuration prevents the A-91 from
    mounting a foregrip.</string>
    <string name="desc_w_pdr">Developed as a Personal Defense Weapon, the PDW-R differs from most other PDW concepts by
    utilizing the standard 5.56mm NATO rounds of the M16 or M4. This allows the PDW-R to share magazines and supply
    lines with standard troops while its short length and bullpup configuration allow the PDW-R to be easily operated in
    CQB. Though it lacks the accuracy of a rifle, the PDW-R has a greater punch at longer ranges than other PDWs.</string>
    <string name="desc_w_m412rex">Developed for export in Russia (REX stands for Revolver for Export), the MP412 is a
    compact .357 Magnum handgun with an interesting tilt open and auto extraction design. While not as powerful as the
    .44 Magnum, the .357 Magnum round from the MP412 offers excellent stopping power and the compact package offers a
    slightly higher rate of accurate fire.</string>
    <string name="desc_w_m4">Visually and mechanically similar to the M16, the M4 Carbine was developed to replace pistols
    and sub-machine guns at the front lines. The M4 is capable Semi-Automatic and 3 Round Burst fire and is equipped
    with accessory rails for end user customization. The rifle has largely replaced the M16A2 previously in use by the
    US Marine Corps.</string>
    <string name="desc_w_m9">Formally known as Pistol, Semiautomatic, 9mm, M9, the M9 was selected as the primary sidearm
    of the entire United States military in 1985. Developed in Italy, the M9 was selected in a series of often disputed
    trials, only narrowly beating out other contenders, because of its high quality and low price. The M9 is the primary
    sidearm of the USMC.</string>
    <string name="desc_w_m1014">An Italian Semi-Automatic Shotgun, delivered to USMC in 1999, the M1014 fires 12 gauge
    rounds without the need for the pump action seen on the M870. A reliable and versatile weapon, the M1014 is also
    equipped with a rail for the mounting of various accessories and an open choke that results in wide pellet spread.</string>
